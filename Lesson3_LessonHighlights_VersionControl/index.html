            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records your changes to a file over time. Version control does this so that the user can go back and recall specific changes that have been made to the file. Version control allows you to revert files back to a previous state or even revert the entire project back to a previous state or the original state. It also allows you to compare your changes over time. If you are using version control while working on a group project it also allows you to who was the last person to modify the project and what could be causing the problem from the modification. Version control allows you to mess up files and lose files but still be able to easily recover them.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git started, like most thing out of controversy. To first understand we have to go back to Linux kernel, from 1992-2002 any time there was maintenance or changes to the software it would be passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002 Linux kernel started using a proprietary server called BitKeeper. In 2005 conflict arose between the company of Linux and the company of Bitkeeper. Due to this the free use of the tool was revoked. This prompted the Linux development team to develop their own tool. They took what they learned from Bitkeeper and created git. They wanted git to be faster, have a simple design, strong support, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When learning git the user should look at like a blank canvas and not compare it to other tools such as Subversion and Perforce. Git stores very differently than other tools. Understanding the differences will help prevent errors. Most other systems store their information as a list based on the changes. Git however thinks of it data differently and stores files almost as snapshots of exactly how the file was at the moment it was saved. To be more efficient git does not store a file that has not been changed over again it just puts a link to the last file. Most of the operations in git are local no other computer is needed. Everything in git is check summed. You cannot lose a file in git without it being detected first. Any actions you do only add data to the database, itâ€™s hard to do something with git that cannot be undone. Git had three main states your file can reside: committed, modified, and staged.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You can get a git project through two ways. One way takes an existing project and imports it into git. The second way clones a git repository from another server. If you want to track an existing project in git you go to the directory and type in "$ git init". This creates a subdirectory that contains all your necessary repository files. Nothing in the project file will be tracked yet. If the user wants to start version-controlling existing files they should begin tracking them and do the initial commit. This can be done with a git add command followed by a git commit command. If the user wants to copy a repository the command used would be git clone. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you have a file that you are pretty much done with but still needs a little tweaking this is where recording changes comes into place. Each file in the directory can be either tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the previous screenshot. This files can be modified, unmodified, or staged. Untracked files are simply just the rest of the files. They are everything else that was not in the last screenshot. If you clone a respiratory all of the files would be considered tracked and unmodified because no editing has been done. As you change files they are seen as modified because they have been changed since the last semester. You then stage the files and lastly commit, and then continue to repeat those steps are the editing continues. </p>
